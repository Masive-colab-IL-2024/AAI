# Description
Documentation about Implementation of IMATO Tomato Leaf Disease Classification, designed to classify leaf images into 10 known classes of Tomato Leaf Disease.

# Project Overview
## A. Background
Tomato farming is one of the vital sectors in the Indonesian agricultural industry. However, this sector faces major challenges with significant crop failure rates, reaching up to 30% of the total crop. Factors such as pest attacks, erratic weather conditions, and plant diseases are the main causes of this failure. In recent years, this condition has been further exacerbated by climate change which has caused unpredictable weather patterns, as well as an increase in pest and disease attacks that are increasingly difficult to control.

## C. Goals
The main goal of the "Tirta Voyageurs" team in developing the "Imato" project is to provide innovative and effective AI technology-based solutions in helping tomato farmers overcome plant disease problems. Using artificial intelligence, we want to create a platform that is able to quickly and accurately diagnose tomato plant diseases through analysis of leaf images uploaded by users.
